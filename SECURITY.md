## Reporting security vulnerabilities or other security related issues

We strongly encourage you to report any security vulnerabilities or related issues you might find in our software to our private security mailing list: fiks-sikkerhet@ks.no - first, before disclosing them in any public forums of any kind.

This is a private mailing list where only members of the KS-Fiks security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.
